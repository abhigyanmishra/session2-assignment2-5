Racks are the holders forhadoop clusters.They consist of slave machines with a rack switch at the top of each rack.
Every slave machine has wires coming out from its two ends.It is basically a collection of many nodes that are connected to the same network switch.This implies that all the nodes are rack-aware.
The network bandwidth between two nodes on different racks is les than the network bandwidth between between two nodes on the same rack.
Racks are very useful for checking for replication and fult tolerance.This is done by replicating the data of one node on another node in a different rack.A pipelime is thus built in this manner.
